# HealthGPT

![Example Conversation](example.png)

HealthGPT is an iOS app that allows users to interact with their health data stored in the Apple Health app using natural language.

Built on top of CardinalKit (via the [CardinalKitTemplateApplication](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/CardinalKitTemplateApplication/)) and OpenAI, HealthGPT offers an easy-to-extend solution for those looking to make large language model powered apps within the Apple Health ecosystem.

## Features

- Chat-style interface for user-friendly health data interaction
- Integration with the Apple Health app to ensure seamless first-party data usage
- Extensible architecture built on [CardinalKit](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/CardinalKit) for easy customization
- GPT-3.5 + GPT-4 access through the [OpenAI](https://github.com/MacPaw/OpenAI) Swift module
- Out of the box support for querying sleep, active energy, exercise minutes, and body mass.

## Set Up

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `src/TemplateApplication.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Wait for all dependencies to install and indexing to finish.
3. Replace the OpenAI API key in `MessageInputView.swift` with your own from OpenAI's dashboard.
4. Run the app (on device or in the simulator) and play with HealthGPT on your own data ðŸš€

Note: if you're using the simulator, you will need to manually add data in the Health app. Otherwise, all of your results will read zero.

You can add queries for additional [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit) quantities and categories as follows:

1. Edit `src/TemplateApplication/HealthDataFetcher.swift` to create an appropriate query for your data type.
2. Update the prompt in `src/TemplateApplication/MessageInputView.swift` to pass the newly acquired data to the OpenAI API.

For any other quick changes (such as adding an onboarding flow), refer to the [CardinalKitTemplateApplication](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/CardinalKitTemplateApplication/) repo.

## TODOs

- [ ] stream GPT responses to the client in order to hide latency (currently broken in the SPM module: https://github.com/MacPaw/OpenAI/issues/14)
- [ ] store the API key in a config/plist file (or generally in a more secure way)
- [ ] enable users to disconnect health data streams at will
- [ ] provide support for more HealthKit types
- [ ] chain LLM queries to first identify which data to pull from HealthKit and then construct a prompt
- [ ] access data from the current day
